# me
I'm a website created to share some ideas with the internet, without relying on data- and dopamine-hungry social medias. If you've found me already, I'm still under construction (!). [Email 'me'](mailto:charlesdgburns@gmail.com) for a special prize.

# 'me'
I'm half English, half Spanish, born and raised in Denmark [at 368 ppm](https://borninppm.com/en/#). I'm currently changing careers to combat climate change. While I'm driven to work towards renewable energy systems, I still remain passionate and curious about neuroscience.
