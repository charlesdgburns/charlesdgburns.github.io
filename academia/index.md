# Research

I enjoy thinking about thinking. How do we do it? What's going on in the flashy flesh sitting inside our brittle skulls? I've had the privelige of asking more precisely formulated questions along this line while assisting research [@CognitiveCircuits](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/cognitive-circuits). Imagine the world of computational neuroscience meeting experimental methods in an epic face-off, that's what happens at this lab.

Prior to this I spent my undergrad learning about maths and psychology. I also unexpecedly learnt to [always sanity-check pipelines against random data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-89257-w).


# Degist

I'm working on a project that aims to communicate the gist of an idea while preserving detail. Stay tuned.
